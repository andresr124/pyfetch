# pyfetch.conf
pyfetch.conf is a config file for PyFetch that makes PyFetch way more flexible and customizable without learning about Python (which is what PyFetch is based on). pyfetch.conf is located in /home/username/.config/pyfetch/pyfetch.conf. The .conf file allows extreme customization without modifying the base of pyfetch.
## Banner Text
Banner Text is a *optional* feature that allows you to change your ASCII text on PyFetch. Just uncomment it then it is enabled by default!
## Plugin Guard
Plugin Guard is a security feature to make sure plugins are not secretly viruses. It is enabled by default but it is not recommended to disable it.
## Sandboxing for Plugins
Sandboxing for Plugins is part of Plugin Guard but a seperated option from Plugin Guard in pyfetch.conf. It is enabled by default but highly discouraged to disable it.
